		<p><b class="subtitle center"><a href="https://github.com/chentetran/snapsassin">Snapsassin</a></b> <br>A mobile app to moderate and play Assassin games with face recognition assassinations. <br>No one has to sit out to moderate the game--Everyone can play! <br>Rather than shooting each other with squirt guns or throwing dirty socks around, this game is played with your phone camera. Snap a photo of your target and their identity will be verified using face recognition. <br>If that's the right person, you've successfully assassinated your target!<br><b><i>Second-place winner of Tufts PolyHack 2016</i></b></p>
		<p><b class="subtitle center"><a href="https://github.com/chentetran/appidemic-android">Appidemic</a></b> <br>A real-time, location-based, massively multi-user outbreak simulator. <br>Currently only on Android, Appidemic is an app that tracks your health status. <br>As you go about your day, if you come into the vicinity of someone who is infected, you get infected! <br>Infection spread and status can be seen on the <a href="https://appidemic.herokuapp.com/">web client</a>, which is a map of the world with all users displayed. <br>This would be an awesome zombie apocalypse simulation game or a perfect tool to study epidemics using real movement based on crowd-sourced information. Probably my best idea yet, although optimizing location tracking and keeping background services alive is kinda difficult (GPS would have to be on all the time; poor battery).</p>
		<p><b class="subtitle center"><a href="https://github.com/alexravan/suechef">SueChef</a></b><br> Sue is your voice-activated cooking assistant. <br>Hands are covered in oil but you need to follow a recipe? <br>Don't touch your phone with those greasy fingers, just call out "Okay, sous-chef" and tell Sue what you need. <br>Based on <i>Recipio</i>, a web app that I worked on with the same purpose that won <b>second place at the BridgeHaCS 2016</b> hackathon. Currently Android-only and in production.</p>
